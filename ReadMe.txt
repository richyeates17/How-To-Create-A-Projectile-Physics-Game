### Tuts+ Tutorial: How To Create A Projectile Physics Game
#### Instructor: Richard Yeates
In this tutorial, we will examine the use of physics to help simulate projectile effects in games. We will look at the basics of using 2D physics in game world space, such as creating bodies and applying impulses and forces. Throughout the course of this tutorial, we will build a working game that you can use as a base for your own projects.
